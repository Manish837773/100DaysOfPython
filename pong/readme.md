## PONG game in Python  (Using Turtle)  
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Python `Turtle` graphics library. The game allows two players to control paddles on either side of the screen and compete to hit a bouncing ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

## Features
- **Two-player gameplay**: Players control paddles using the keyboard.
- **Paddle movement**: Paddles can move up and down.
- **Scoring system**: Each player gets a point when the opponent misses the ball.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Code editor of choice(Ex: VSCode, Pycharm etc)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo 
2. Make sure Python is installed in your machine
3. Navigate to the `main.py` file and run it using any editor of your choice.
